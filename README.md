# Effects-of-Fuel-Taxes-on-Carbon-Emissions
This repository contains all code and data needed to conduct analysis on "Effects of Fuel Taxes on Carbon Emissions" in OECD countries.

The code cosists of two parts with different methods:
1) Synthetic Control Method for emission reduction estimates
2) Regression analyses for tax incidence and tax salience investigation

All code is written in R.
R packages I used to conduct the analysis are: Synth, sandwich, lmtest, stargazer, AER, car, rio, and Tidyverse.

Data used for the analysis stems from different sources open to the public:
- AMECO database by European Comission (Link)
- World Bank database (Link)
- WDI database by World Bank (Link)
- Eurostat database (Link)
- Odyssee indicator database by EEA (Link)
- UN Statistical Yearbook
- "Energy Prices and Taxes" published by IEA
